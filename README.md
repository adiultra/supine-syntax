# Supine-Syntax Theme

A vividly flat theme.

Supine focuses on flat and colourful, it is biased towards blue (and is great with `arc gtk` theme in linux)

It works extremely well with `atom-material` ui.

## Extra

The colors for primary and ascent are:

primary: `#2f343f`

ascent: `#899ec3`


Also, use contrasting panels, themed tab-bar and shadows of panels in the atom-material settings.
